# Data Analysis Project: Optimizing Marketing ROI

## 🎯 Problem Statement
The marketing team is currently wasting budget on mass marketing campaigns without knowing which customers respond best. We need to identify high-value customer segments to optimize campaign ROI and reduce churn.

## ❓ Decision Questions (Key KPIs)
This project aims to answer three core questions to support business decisions:
1. **Customer Value:** Which demographic segment (Income/Age/Education) generates the highest total revenue?
2. **Channel Efficiency:** Which sales channel (Web vs. Store vs. Catalog) drives the most high-value purchases?
3. **Campaign Optimization:** Is there a correlation between household structure (kids/teens) and the acceptance of premium marketing campaigns?
