# Data Analysis Project: Optimizing Marketing ROI
**Group:** Nova

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Marketing budgets are limited. The company runs multiple campaigns, but it is unclear which customer groups respond best or which channels create the most impact. A data-driven strategy is needed to optimize future marketing decisions. We need to identify high-value customer segments to optimize campaign ROI and reduce churn.

## ❓ Decision Questions (Key KPIs)
This project aims to answer three core questions to support business decisions:
1. **Customer Value:** Which demographic segment (Income/Age/Education) generates the highest total revenue?
2. **Channel Efficiency:** Which sales channel (Web vs. Store vs. Catalog) drives the most high-value purchases?
3. **Campaign Optimization:** Is there a correlation between household structure (kids/teens) and the acceptance of premium marketing campaigns?

## 🔄 Workflow Summary

### 1. **Week 1:** Planning & Setup (✅ Completed)
* Defined problem statement & setup GitHub repository.
* Established team roles and decision questions.

### 2. **Week 2:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (✅ Completed)
Used Python & SQL to identify errors and understand data distribution.
* **Data Quality Check:** Identified outliers (Age > 100, Income > $600k) and null values.
* **Findings:** * Found 3 customers born before 1900 (removed).
    * Validated Income distribution to set filtering thresholds.

### 3. **Week 3:** SQL Data Modelling (✅ Completed)
Built a **Star Schema** to optimize performance for Tableau.
* **Data Cleaning Logic:** Applied filters `Year_Birth >= 1940` and `Income <= 200,000`.
* **Schema Design:**
    * `Dim_Customer`: ID, Age, Education, Marital Status, Kidhome.
    * `Fact_Performance`: Total Spend, Conversion Rate, Channel Purchases.
* **KPI Definitions:**
    * *Total Spend* = Sum of all Mnt products.
    * *Conversion Rate* = Accepted Campaigns / Total Customers.

### 4. **Week 4:** Dashboard & Strategic Insights (✅ Completed)
**Goal:** Visualize insights using Tableau to answer the 3 Decision Questions.

#### a. Dashboard Components
Here is the preview of our interactive dashboard:
![Dashboard Preview]([/dashboard/Final_Dashboard_Overview.png](https://public.tableau.com/views/DataDecisionMarketingFinal/Dashboard1?:language=en-GB&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link))


We constructed an interactive dashboard with 4 key visualizations:
1.  **Revenue by Education (Bar Chart):** Identified "Graduation" and "PhD" as the top revenue-generating segments.
2.  **Income vs. Spending (Scatter Plot):** Confirmed a strong positive correlation between income and spending, with specific outliers identified.
3.  **Channel Efficiency (Bar Chart):** "Store" is the dominant channel, followed by "Web".
4.  **The 'Kid Penalty' (Line Chart):** Visualized the negative impact of family size on conversion rates.

#### b. Key Strategic Findings
* **High-Value Profile:** Customers with **PhD/Graduation** degrees and **Income > $70k** drive ~60% of revenue.
* **The "Kid Penalty":** Household structure is the strongest predictor of campaign success.
    * *0 Kids:* **~17.5%** Conversion Rate (High)
    * *1 Kid:* **~12.2%** Conversion Rate (Medium)
    * *2 Kids:* **~4.1%** Conversion Rate (Low)
* **Channel Strategy:** While Stores drive volume, the **Web** channel is crucial for high-income, childless professionals.

#### AI Agent Integration
We utilized AI Agents to analyze customer clustering and validate our findings.
* **Prompt:** "Analyze customer clusters based on income and family size to suggest budget reallocation."
* **AI Insight:** Suggested shifting budget from large families (low conversion) to childless professionals (high conversion).

#### **Recommendations (Action Plan)**
Based on the AI-Driven Analysis and Dashboard insights:
1. Stop Wasting Budget: Cease all "Gold/Wine" premium marketing campaigns for families with 2+ children (Negative ROI predicted).
2. Budget Reallocation: Shift 30% of the budget to strictly target the "Childless Professionals" segment (Income > $70k, 0 Kids).
3. Channel Pivot: Enhance the Web user experience for the younger, tech-savvy demographic, while maintaining Store inventory for general shoppers.

### Week 5: Final Insights & Strategic Recommendations

#### Answers to Decision Questions
1. **Customer Value:** High-income earners ($70k+) with **Graduation/PhD** degrees are the primary revenue drivers, as shown in our Income vs. Spending Scatter Plot.
2. **Channel Efficiency:** **Store Purchases** dominate in volume, but the **Web channel** is the most effective gateway for high-income professionals.
3. **The "Kid Penalty" Pattern:** We identified a critical trend where Campaign Conversion Rates plunge as family size increases (0 Kids: 17.5% vs. 2+ Kids: 4.1%).

#### AI-Driven Recommendations
Based on our AI Agent analysis of 2,240 customers:
* **Stop Wasting Budget:** Cease all "Gold/Wine" premium campaigns for families with 2+ children (Negative ROI predicted).
* **Strategic Reallocation:** Shift **30% of the budget** to target the "Childless Professionals" segment (Income > $70k, 0 Kids), which shows a 4x higher propensity to purchase.

#### Project Reflection
* **What worked well:** Successful integration of **SQL Star Schema** for data stability and **AI Agents** for rapid insight generation. Our Dashboard 2 provides a clear, interactive path to decision-making.
* **What could be improved:** In future iterations, we aim to include **Shipping & Operational Costs** to calculate "Net Profit" instead of just "Revenue".
* **Future Work:** Implementing **Predictive Modeling** (Churn Prediction) to anticipate customer behavior.
